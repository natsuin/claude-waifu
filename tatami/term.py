"""A terminal for the Tatami Room app. It runs an agent (Claude, or another kind from kinds.json:
Gemini, Codex) in a pseudo-terminal inside WSL, the way a Claude Waifu window runs Claude, and
relays it over plain pipes: the app starts it through wsl.exe and draws it with xterm.js, so
nothing needs native modules on the Windows side.

The agent doesn't belong to the app, so restarting the app (to update it, or after a crash)
doesn't stop it. A small holder in the background owns the pseudo-terminal, keeps what the
agent printed lately, and waits on a socket in ~/.local/state/tatami/terms; what the app runs
attaches to it, gets that backlog first (so the app can draw the screen again), then relays.
When the app goes away the holder carries on, and the app attaches again when it comes back.
The holder ends when the agent's shell exits, or when the app ends the terminal.

It starts in ~/desk, a folder of its own: Claude Code asks once whether you trust a folder, and
remembers the answer for that folder, where your home folder would ask every time.

  tatami term <session> [kind]    what the app runs: attach to that session's holder, starting
                                  it (and the agent) first if there's none; <kind> says which
                                  agent (claude when it's left out)
  tatami term --list              the sessions whose holders are running, as JSON lines
                                  ({"session", "kind"}), for the app to attach to again

The app resizes the terminal in-band: ESC ] 7373 ; resize ; <cols> ; <rows> BEL, and ends it
with ESC ] 7373 ; end BEL. Before it starts, waifu picks a girl and a color for it, like it
does for each new window.
