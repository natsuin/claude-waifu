"""Tatami Room board: a web page that shows every running agent as a card. Agents on a team
sit in their team's room; the rest wait on their own along the top. Drag a card into a room
and that agent joins the room's team channel; drop one card onto another and the two of them
get a new room.

It only reads and writes the team channel's plain files in ~/.local/state/tatami. It
can't run commands or reach any terminal. It listens on this PC only (127.0.0.1), and
every request needs the secret token that's in the page's address, so other programs,
other devices and other websites can't use it.

  python3 board.py [--port 7373]    (or run ./tatami, which also opens it in your browser)
