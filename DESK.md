# Tatami Room: design goal

> **Status: work in progress.** The team channel, the board and group looks (steps 1 to 3 of the build order below) work today, and the desk has its own window, a **+ Claude** button and click-to-open. Next: the agents' terminals inside the desk. Other companies come after that.

Tatami Room's window looks give each Claude Code window a girl and a color. **The desk** is the bigger picture: **a desktop for a whole host of AI agents**, from any company, that you can drag together to work on the same project.

The name comes from tatami, the woven mats that fit side by side to make a Japanese room: lay agents side by side and you've built a room for a project.

This is the plan and the reasoning behind it. The polished design comes later. For now the desk borrows the window looks (a color per window, a dot-art girl behind the text), so it's easy to see what's going on while it's being built.

## The goal

Something anyone can pick up without learning it. No menus to memorize, no session IDs, no commands. You see your agents as windows, you drag them around, and you drop them together when you want them to work together.

## How it should feel

1. You boot WSL and the desk opens.
2. You click **+ Claude**. A window appears with Claude already running, a girl behind the text, and a color no other window has.
3. You work on your project for a bit.
4. You want help, so you click **+ Claude** (or **+ Gemini**) again and drag the new window onto the first one.
5. Now they're a team. They work in the same project folder, share a group color, and can talk to each other: one can hand the other a task, ask a question, or report what it did.

## The look

Fluid, the way Apple's interfaces are (2026-10-01; it replaced a desk drawn as a tatami room, which didn't land). Every agent is a card that looks like a small copy of its own window: the window's color, with its girl drawn in dots, as Terminal shows her, drawn big enough that the dots read as dots. A team's cards sit together on a stage of frosted glass lit faintly in the room's color, sized to its cards, and stages sit side by side as they fit. What a team said shows under its cards as message bubbles in each speaker's color. The header is frosted glass with your usage as two Activity-style rings.

Everything moves on springs. Whatever changes place glides there (a card joining a room, a room moving down a row, the desk making room for the terminal panel), new cards grow in, and gone ones fade where they stood. A dragged card lifts, leans into the direction your hand moves, and springs down into its place when you let go. On the desk itself, nothing moves on its own except what asks for you: a breathing dot on a working agent, a slow sky-blue glow on one whose turn is over, and a quick red glow on one that needs your OK.

Behind it all is a night sky (2026-10-01): stars, tonight's moon in its real phase, and a branch reaching in from the right, with petals falling at three depths. Middle ones settle a while on top of a room or a card on its own, close ones drift in front of the cards, and a moving hand or a carried card stirs them. A card landing in a room knocks them off and throws up petals of the room's flower in its colour; a new team brings a gust; an agent that turns up throws up a few in its own colour. The button beside **+ Room** picks the season (sakura, momiji leaves, snow with red plum, or fireflies) and how many fall, or none, and the desk remembers. Each flower room wears its flower as a crest (kamon) in the corner of its stage, stamped in when the room is made; a room you named yourself wears the desk's mark.

## Principles

- **A host of agents, not one.** The unit is a team working on a project, not a single chat.
- **Any company.** Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and whatever comes next. If it runs in a terminal, it can live on the desk.
- **Claude as the hub.** Other agents join a team, and Claude coordinates by default.
- **Drag to decide.** Grouping, joining a project and teaming up are all done by dragging, not by forms or settings.
- **Tell them apart at a glance.** Every window keeps a distinct color and girl, carried over from the window looks.
- **Nothing gets lost.** Your agents live in their own windows. Closing the board never touches them.
- **Local and safe.** Everything runs on your own PC. The board's server can't reach any terminal or run commands; it only arranges agents into rooms. It listens on this machine only and needs a secret token. The desk's buttons (**+ Claude**, and clicking a card to bring up its window) are `tatami-room:` links that Windows hands to a small script, which can do those two things and nothing else.

## How it works

- **Agents live in real Terminal windows.** Each one is a normal Claude Waifu window (later also Gemini and Codex), with its own girl and color.
- **The board shows them as cards.** Every running agent announces itself through the team channel, so the board can show it as a card. A new window starts on its own; one started in a project folder joins that project's room. Dropping one card onto another makes them a team, and dragging a card into a room changes which team the agent belongs to, and nothing else.
- **Teams talk through MCP.** Claude Code, Gemini CLI and Codex all support MCP, the plug-in standard for giving agents new tools. Each project gets a shared channel, an MCP server every agent in the team connects to, with tools to post updates, read the others' messages and ask each other for help. Dragging an agent onto a team connects it to that team's channel.

## Build order

Each step is usable on its own.

1. **The team channel.** *(done: [tatami/tatami_mcp.py](tatami/tatami_mcp.py))* An MCP server, standard library only, with three tools: `room_post`, `room_read` and `room_members`. Agents working in the same project folder share a room automatically; an agent started in your home folder is on its own until you team it up. It stores plain files in `~/.local/state/tatami` and uses no network. A fourth tool, `room_invite`, came later (see Helpers below).
2. **The board.** *(done: [tatami/board.py](tatami/board.py) and [board.html](tatami/board.html))* A local page showing each running agent as a card. Agents on their own wait in a strip along the top. Drop one card onto another to make a team: they get a new room, named the way a ryokan names its rooms, after a flower in the room's color (sakura is pink, fuji is lavender). Drag a card into a room to join that team, or onto the strip to take it off its team. **+ Room** makes an empty room with a name you choose. Run [`tatami/tatami`](tatami/tatami) to start the board and open it in your browser; `tatami stop` closes it. Your agents don't need it running.
3. **Group looks.** *(done)* The windows of a team get a matching tab color, the same color the board gives their room, so teams stand out at a glance. No two rooms share a color while they're around, and every color is light enough for Terminal to write the tab title in black. Each agent's channel keeps its own window's tab in step through `waifu`, which owns Terminal's settings; the board still never touches a terminal.
4. **More companies.** Gemini and Codex joining rooms alongside Claude, using the same channel. *(next)*

Next ideas: terminals that outlive the app (today they end when it quits), and showing Windows Terminal sessions inside the app too.

Later: bring in other companies' agents (step 4), and give the app its own icon inside the .exe.

Started early:

- **Claude inside the app.** **+ Claude** starts Claude in a terminal of the app's own, in a panel beside the desk, over its own girl and color. `tatami term` runs Claude in a pseudo-terminal inside WSL and relays it over plain pipes; the app draws it with xterm.js, so there are no native modules. The terminals start in `~/desk`, which, like the home folder, isn't a project, so their agents start on their own. The board's server still runs nothing: the app starts the terminals.
- **Fast.** The app crosses into WSL once, not on every click: each agent finds its own window when it starts, the app brings it up by that window's handle through a helper it keeps running, and the board pushes changes as they happen instead of the page asking every few seconds.
- **The desk is a Windows app.** Tatami Room runs as its own app ([app/](app/)): Electron's runtime around the desk page, so the page stays one piece that also works in a browser. The app starts the desk's server inside WSL and holds WSL up while it runs, opens and brings up windows for the desk's buttons without any browser prompt, runs as a single copy with its own taskbar identity, quits when closed (or, while Claude runs in its terminals, can keep running in the tray), and pops up a Windows notification when an agent needs your OK (with the hooks on). The installer downloads a pinned Electron release, at least a week old, and checks it against Electron's published checksum.
- **+ Claude and click-to-open.** The desk's **+ Claude** button opens a new Claude Waifu window, and clicking a card (or Enter on it) brings that agent's window to the front. The desk finds an agent's window from inside the agent's own WSL session: a small script started through that session shares its console, and the console belongs to the window the agent lives in. So it works for every window, however it was opened, and gives it the focus too.
- **The desk is an app.** A **Tatami Room** shortcut (desktop and Start menu, with the mark as its icon) starts the board if needed and opens it in a window of its own: Brave, Chrome or Edge without tabs or an address bar. Clicking it again brings up the open desk instead of a second one. The first Claude Waifu window after WSL starts opens the desk too (`tatami autostart off` stops that), and while a desk window is open it holds WSL up, since WSL otherwise stops soon after its last terminal closes.
- **Your usage on the desk.** The board's header shows your 5-hour and weekly Claude usage, with reset times, from the Tatami Room status line ([extras/statusline.py](extras/statusline.py)), which leaves the numbers in `~/.local/state/tatami/usage.json` whenever they change.
- **Helpers and better teamwork** (after the first real team, 2026-10-01). Three agents shared a room. The one doing the work missed the room until a helper had finished, a bug report went unread, and an offer of help got no answer. So: `room_members` and `room_post` say who has read your messages and who is waiting for you, the channel's instructions cover offering concrete pieces and handing work off, the hooks tell a busy agent when messages arrive, and the board puts a badge with the unread count on each card. `room_invite` lets an agent bring in a helper in a new Claude Waifu window ([tatami/helper.py](tatami/helper.py)): you can see it and talk to it, unlike a subagent, which is hidden and speaks only to its parent. At most two per agent, and helpers can't bring in more.
- **The board shows which agents need you.** Run `tatami hooks on` once and Claude Code tells the board what each agent is doing ([tatami/hooks.py](tatami/hooks.py)). A card reads *working*, *your turn* or *needs your OK*, a card whose turn is over glows softly, and one waiting on a permission prompt glows red, with a count in the board's tab title. `tatami hooks off` takes the hooks out again.

## Not goals, for now

- A finished visual design.
- Anything online: accounts, sync, sharing.
- Replacing the agents' own interfaces. The desk hosts them; each window is still the real CLI.
